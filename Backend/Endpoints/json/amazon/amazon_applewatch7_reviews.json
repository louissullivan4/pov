			"review": "I have had a number of Apple watches and they continue to get better.The quality is top notch and the oxygen sensor is a great addition.I would prefer them to make it thicker and put a larger battery inside, however, the battery tends to last me 2 days and charges very quickly.The midnight colour looks black for the most part but has a deep blue shine to when light hits it directly, barely noticeable and one thing I was worried about before purchase.The only disappointment for me was that the always on brightness looks no brighter than that of the Apple watch 5. If they could improve that as well as make many more watch faces then I would be happy. One thing I don’t understand is why the time looks so poor when in power save mode, how hard would it be to centre it on the screen.Recommended.",

			"review": "I bought this watch for my son for a Christmas present. He said it takes a bit to set up but once he done it, well he seems to love it as hes never off it! It has loads of stuff on it to keep him entertained, which is always a good thing!Even in work were he cant take his phone, he can still see if anything important comes up on his watch.Everything he can do on a phone, he can do on his watch, his fitness has also improved as his watch tells him everything! Its also good on a night out, as he doesnt need to take his phone now, so cant lose it!Its been a brilliant buy for me as my sons over the moon with it and it keeps him entertained with the many apps on it, and i get a quiet life, win win for us!",
