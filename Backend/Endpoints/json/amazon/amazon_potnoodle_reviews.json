		"review": "I love sweet chilli things and I love noodles/dehydrated products for a quick sback or lunch.So I thought I would make a change from favourite (and usual) go to which is mugshot macaroni cheese.And these are great.Upon opening the packet and seeing the sweet chilli powder I was sceptical about the flavour/strength of the chillies but I stuck to the instructions and made it as it should be made (I was constantly fighting my inner self as I so wanted to add crushed chillies to be sure it was of a decent standard flavour).But I have to say I was more than pleasantly surprised to find the sachet amount is just right.It doesn't taste too hot whilst eating it (i am used to a stronger sting) but it was very warming and you have that lovely warm tingling on your lips after eating it.There will be days when i want to boost the chilli strength but it will be very occasionally as it is great just as it comes.It took just 5 minutes to make this lovely snack and I am so glad I took the gamble to try them (I loved the thought of the mugshot cajun flavour but i was very disappointed with that).But I love this product so much that I reviewed it immediately after eating it and I then immediately ordered a couple of more cases to be delivered tomorrow.Happy days.Best wishes",

Ok if I use the noodles with some chinese flavoured gravy from mayflower. I recommend the Mi goreng noodles",
