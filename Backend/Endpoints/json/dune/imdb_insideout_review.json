		"reviewText": "One important note: If you go see \"Inside Out\" be sure to get there on time so that you can see the short that precedes it, \"Lava\". It's an amazing short film--one of the best CGI shorts I've ever seen. But, like \"Inside Out\", its audience really is adults, not kids.\n\nThis film appears to have been inspired by a now defunct but wonderful exhibit at Epcot at Disney World. Cranium Command was a strange movie which featured lots of film clips and audio animatronics to embody the various emotions battling within a young boy. Here in \"Inside Out\", you have a group of entities that also embody the feelings...but in a young girl. When the film focuses on these five emotions, it's at its best---clever, fun and often sweet and tender. Unfortunately, the film loses its way a bit in the middle--and seems to have succumbed to some distractions. Fortunately, it finds its way very well at the end-- and ending which is incredibly satisfying and perhaps might require some Kleenex.\n\nThe film is incredibly well animated and I was impressed by the 3-D version as it used this technology well. Additionally, the story is nothing like any CGI film I've ever seen. My only reservation is that the story might be a bit difficult for children to understand and the plot seems much more for older kids, teens and, especially, adults.",

		"reviewText": "Most of Pixar's films are wonderful (short films too), and while the three films made after Toy Story 3 weren't up to their top standards they were still better than most animation companies at their worst. Inside Out was nothing short of a masterwork, Pixar's best since Toy Story 3 and one of their best overall.\n\nPixar films can be relied upon to have great animation, and Inside Out certainly does have great animation. No, wonderful animation and some of the company's most ingeniously inventive, with gorgeously vibrant colours, a very imaginatively rendered setting (and the lands even more ingeniously done, the next land more so than the last), very meticulous and beautifully modelled backgrounds and clever character designs that match the emotions more than ideally. Michael Giacchino's sparkling, rousing and very charming score is one of my personal favourite scores of the year so far, and every bit as great as his score for Up.\n\nA superb job was done with the script here too, the comedy is clever and witty without ever being forced and balances subtly with the drama, the drama is some of the most truly poignant of any Pixar film and it doesn't ever feel manipulative or overdone and it's very smartly insightful. The story, not one of THE most innovative concepts but is one of the more imaginative uses of it and is quite original for Pixar actually, goes at a slightly steadier pace than other Disney films, but still captivated. It was very easy to completely connect with Riley and her situation and this was easily the Pixar film since Toy Story 3 that I connected with emotionally the most, also one of Pixar's most moving stories quite easily.\n\nLoved the characters too, Anger, Fear, Disgust and Bing Bong (the imaginary friend and the 'epitome of immaturity', without ever being annoying, his back story did bring a tear to the eye) stole every scene they were in, and even Sadness managed to crack some funny one-liners even in her depressive state. Joy also positively lights up the screen and Riley was easy to connect with and much more than just a stereotypical teen girl. The voice acting is splendid. Amy Poehler is note perfect as Joy with her spirited banter giving the character so much life while also bringing a human element to her as well, Lewis Black gives an explosively barn-storming turn as Anger, Phyllis Smith is amusing and affecting, Bill Hader and Mindy Kaling are similarly priceless and in a way that makes the characters of Fear and Disgust endearing rather than annoying, Richard Kind is innocently charming and Kyle MacLachlan and Diane Lane are appropriately compassionate.\n\nOverall, a masterful return to form for Pixar. It's their best since Toy Story 3 and one of their best overall as well. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

		"reviewText": "Inside Out (2015) \n\n*** 1/2 (out of 4)\n\nEleven-year-old Riley has a wonderfully fun childhood thanks to the emotions working inside of her. Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling) all help keep the young girl moving forward but when her family moves from Minnesota to San Fransisco it throws everyone for a loop and soon Joy and Sadness find themselves lost in her system and trying to find their way back.\n\nINSIDE OUT is certainly another winner from Pixar who are clearly the experts of the family movie. What really amazes me about the studio is that they're actually just making adult movies that kids happen to enjoy because of the pretty characters on the screen. I say this because films like this one, UP and WALL-E really do have adult stories dealing with adult issues yet somehow the studios are able to keep kids entertained while their parents get a lot more of the jokes and the emotions that the story provides. This one here is an incredibly touching story from a parent's point of view simply because of the changes that their kids go through.\n\nThere's no doubt that the animation is the star of this picture and we're really treated to some wonderful images. I especially loved the use of colors in the picture and how various colors had a certain emotion attached to it. This is certainly excellent once our adventure begins as there's a \"long term memory\" section where these wonderful color marble like things are collection. Just the site of this are a true treat for the eyes. All of the \"emotion\" characters are perfectly brought to life with both Joy and Anger really standing out. The human characters are also quite entertaining and there's no doubt that the Bing Bong character will go down as a favorite decades from now.\n\nAs I said, this film is going to work a lot better for older kids and adults as I'm sure the majority of young children aren't fully going to grasp the idea of emotions and how they effect our lives. The story itself is quite charming throughout and I was surprised at how many adult issues they were able to work on throughout the running time. Fans of Pixar are certainly going to love this as it's another winner that manages to work no matter what your age is. Still, I think the older you are the more you'll enjoy it.",

		"reviewText": "As is often the case, before I could see this film, I had a host of people tell me how it affected them. Tears, creativity, uniquely presented emotions. This always shades the stuff I feel personally. While it didn't speak to me as much as others, I have to admit that it was enjoyable and highly creative. We have as our protagonist, Riley, a little girl who has been fawned on her whole life. She is happy like all kids with a few bumps along the way, as well as typical behavior. We find out that she has been formed by a set of emotions who take on an anthropomorphic being. The five of them create her personality. Unfortunately for her, the family moves from its idyllic setting in Minnesota to San Francisco, where everything is indeed different. During this time, the five emotions become unsettled and this becomes a kind of adventure tale. Joy and Sadness get shot out of their control center, and while they are finding their ways back, Riley begins to fall apart. The strength of this animated film has to do with all aspects of consciousness, such the area of creativity and art where the characters are turned into Picasso figures and later two dimensional figures. There is also the \"Train\" of consciousness, as well as some Freudian stuff to work with. Memories are save on little orbs and are at the center of putting a person back together again. An imaginary friend is brought in as well. This is quite adult at times, showing things that the kids just won't get. Well worth the time to see it. Oh, I know it's been said before. Stop giving movies ones unless they are deserving. Your job is to review, not to vilify things that aren't perfect. A one should be used to evaluate a cheap 1950's horror movie or an exploitation film, not a thoughtful animated feature that has charmed the vast majority of viewers.",

		"reviewText": "It has been quite some time since \"Up\", the last full feature movie Pete Docter directed, but he hasn't forgotten anything in these past 5 years. \"Inside Out\" runs for slightly over 100 minutes and is a most creative take on what is going on inside a young girl's head when she has to leave her home state Minnesota to move to San Francisco. There are 5 states of emotion inside her head, all in different colors: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust. I have to say I was quite wondering for a large part of the film why 4 are negative and only one is positive. My explanation is probably that from the filmmaker's perspective it made sense as the positive one and one of the negative ones are absent for a while and this is when the girl is at her worst.\n\nI thought this movie needed a little while to really get going. It got better when Joy and Sadness left the central and we actually had one positive and one negative emotion in the center of the movie and also the characters they meet on their journey together. The most memorable of these is probably Bing Bong, an imaginary friend the girl had when she was younger. The disappearance of Bing Bong is also one of the most emotional moments down in the dark valley of lost memories. This valley was an inclusion as smart as the one that all memories are stored in balls. Another part I liked from a more positive perspective was the one scene where we see the girl ice skating and we see Joy do exactly the same in a synchronous manner, possibly my favorite moment from the first half of the movie.\n\nThe ending is absolutely brilliant again, Pixar at their best. It already starts with the Bing Bong scene I mentioned earlier, but it keeps going until the very end. The moment we see Joy let Sadness touch these balls of the past, so these memories stop being pleasant, but become sad memories is something that will wet your eyes. It's necessary to see these as sad in order to make space for new positive memories. And the home sickness scene that follows right afterwards is at least as good with the girl and her parents hugging it out.\n\nIt's tough to find any criticism with this movie. Maybe one would be that I did not like the first half as much as the second half and that with all the displays of great animation and creativity, the movie sometimes had long sequences that lacked being really funny. Or that they were some childish scenes early on like the constant monkey imitation game, which certainly elaborates on the characters' relationships, but may have been enough once or twice. \"Inside Out\" is the big front-runner for animated movie of the year and very likely to win the Oscar in that category. Deservedly so. This is on par with Pixar's best, especially towards the end. I saw that there will be a little short film that follows the feature film and I am curious about how this is gonna look like. Oh yeah, I also liked how they went into other people's heads occasionally, such as the parents, or some others during the closing credits. This really brought some nice comic relief.\n\nAll in all, \"Inside Out\" is another triumph for both Pixar and Disney. The younger audiences will have a fun time with all the colorful and entertaining characters and the grown-ups will as well because of the emotional impact this movie makes. Highly recommended and finally also a quick word on \"Lava\", a short film that is shown before the movie in theaters and has a beautiful storyline and music as well: I did not like the German dub as much as the English original, but it was still an entertaining 5-6 minutes. Do not miss out on these two, because you would really miss out on a lot of awesomeness.",

Of course, even without this, the film still has the weight of other great Pixar movies down the years, so it already has a high bar to clear even without the additional hype. Watching it for myself though I was surprised by how little I thought of such things, and how totally I just enjoyed the film on its own terms. Ironically, I did this because of how accurate all the positive reviews and buzz were, because Inside Out is a really great film.\n\nConstructed on a reality which all parents of older children will no doubt connect to, the film takes the emotional change of a girl into a young teenager and puts it into a comedic adventure story set inside her head. The world inside her head is not only engaging, but incredibly smart \u2013 how accurate it is to the real world of psychology (if those words fit together) I do not know, but it is impressively constructed and also designed to make sense, be accessible, and also create a world for colorful characters to delight on an adventure level while also carrying the emotional punch to deliver a much bigger story (although also a very personal one too). It is as moving as it is funny, and as insightful and as it fun, and it is impressive how it is all put together. The animation is topnotch as ever, and the voice cast are not just famous names but well cast famous names who fit their characters well \u2013 with Poehler being a strong lead, while Smith, Black, Kaling, and Hader all doing great work (along with many other supporting characters \u2013 not least of which being Dias as Riley herself).\n\nI doubt voters would be able to bring themselves to vote for it to win Best Picture while being 'just a cartoon' but at the same time it is hard to imagine that 2015 will produce a better, smarter, and more effective film.",

They utilize the words worst, boring, overrated, very boring, terrible, leave the theater, over simplified, and missed the point to describe the picture.\n\nSo maybe there's some hope out there. My point being that the present day emphasis, especially on college campuses, seems to be about 'feelings' and a failure to effectively engage with reality. Anything considered negative is to be shunned or discriminated against, with alternative points of view to be banned outright. Sorry, but this leads to the next generation that can't effectively cope when things don't go their way. It's best exemplified in the movie when one of the characters proclaims \"Medals! Ribbons! Everyone's a winner!\" In my book, when everyone's a winner, no one is.\n\nBut the thing is, the picture is wrapped up in all these pretty colors and it's easy to get lost in the sentimentality that goes with Goofball, Friendship and Imagination Islands. I actually thought all those memory towers were pretty cool looking with the myriads of bright colored balls representing past events. There's even some creativity involved with things like the Train of Thought (going all over the place), and the Islands of Personality.\n\nBut over all, I didn't get a sense of a positive message coming out of this picture for young kids, which I presume is the target audience. Instead of learning how to cope in a new environment, Riley and her parents gave up and went back home to Minnesota instead of toughing it out for success in San Francisco. I guess they felt it was the right thing to do.",

		"reviewText": "I should start by saying that I'm not any fan of Disney movies. Even so, \"Inside Out\" is an interesting look at the evolution of human emotions and the problems that people can have adjusting to a new location. I particularly liked the part where they showed dreams getting produced Hollywood-style. My personal favorite of the emotions was Anger, just because I liked the way that he was always about to explode. If there were another emotion in Riley's head, maybe it would be cynicism (is that considered an emotion?). I haven't seen any of 2015's other nominees for Best Animated Feature, so I can't compare this one, but it seems as though they only award Disney movies.\n\nAnd of course I can't avoid talking about the cast. Amy Poehler and Bill Hader are former \"Saturday Night Live\" cast members (co-star Bobby Moynihan still is). Lewis Black does skits in the persona of someone approaching a mental breakdown, so he's the perfect person to voice Anger. Mindy Kaling is best known as a comedian, but made a good point about the lack of attention paid to the recent murder of an Indian-American (by someone who said \"Get out of our country!\"). This is the first that I've ever heard of Phyllis Smith or Richard Kind. Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan are pretty well known. Paula Poundstone had been around for years before I heard about her (and I heard about her due to her run-in with the law). Frank Oz is best known for his Muppets work but has also directed a number of movies, including one called \"In & Out\" (IMDb needs to include that in the trivia). Flea is a member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. John Ratzenberger voiced the piggy bank in \"Toy Story\". Rashida Jones is Quincy Jones's daughter.\n\nAll in all, a pretty enjoyable movie.",

		"reviewText": "After young Riley is uprooted from her Midwest life and moved to San Francisco, her emotions -- Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness -- conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.\n\nAs with many popular, successful movies, this one has caused a great deal of response on the Internet. Many people love it, and it currently (January 2016) sits in the Top 100 on IMDb. And, of course, we begin to get a push back with people calling it overrated, over-hyped, and some even saying it is offensive in its depiction of gender and inappropriate for children.\n\nThe path it has followed through award season has had a similar up and down trajectory. Early on, it was seen as the clear winner of the animation Oscar and even in the running for Best Picture. Gradually slipping, it now seems to be 50/50 for animation (up against \"Anomalisa\") with zero chance of getting anywhere near Best Picture. Sorry, Pixar.\n\nAs with anything, the reality is never as rosy or as bleak as the Internet would like it to be. \"Inside Out\" may not be Best Picture, but it has a better-than-average chance of landing the animation Oscar. And that is because you rarely get a cartoon that reaches this deep inside its audience. A film about emotions (or lack thereof) that actually makes you feel.\n\nThis is not a children's movie. The kids will enjoy the bright colors and characters, especially Bing Bong. And there is nothing \"adult\" in terms of violence, nudity or cursing. (There is one subtle reference to the San Francisco homosexual community, but it is not offensive or derogatory.) This may be the darkest Pixar film yet, thematically. Depression, loneliness, alienation. The adults are the ones who will really appreciate this sad story of change and end of innocence.\n\nDirector Pete Docter, who previously made \"Up\", has set the bar high for himself here if he continues making movies (which, of course, he will). He could even have achieved for himself a place alongside John Lasseter in the hall of great animation directors. He assembled this one just right, down to the voices -- Lewis Black and Phyllis Smith are the very embodiment of the emotions they portray.\n\nAlthough the best animation in recent years remains \"Wreck-It Ralph\", this film clearly has to rank among the finest, giving such movies as \"Ralph\" and \"Toy Story 3\" a run for their money.",

		"reviewText": "This new Disney/Pixar film, from the creators of Toy Story and Up, was being advertised a lot a few months before release, including in Sky Broadband and Subway adverts, the concept definitely looked appealing to me, and critics were giving it high praise, so I was really up for seeing it. Basically a girl named Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) is born in Minnesota, and her five key emotions were manifested one by one, Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Anger (Lewis Black), the emotions live in Headquarters, Riley's conscious mind, where they influence Riley's actions and memories via a control console. Riley's new memories created are stored in coloured orbs, they are all sent to storage at the end of every waking period, the most important \"core\" memories are housed in a Headquarters hub and power five \"islands\" each reflecting Riley's personality: Hockey Island - created from Riley's love for the sport, Goofball Island - created from Riley's fun-loving side, Family Island - created from her love of her family, Honesty Island - created from her honest nature, and Friendship Island - created from her ability to have and make friends. Joy is Riley's dominant emotion, keeping Riley in a happy state, she and the other emotions do not understand the purpose of Sadness, it is when Riley has turned 11 that her family are relocating to San Francisco after her Dad (Kyle MacLachlan) gets a new job, and Sadness is somehow causing happy memories to turn sad, and Sadness causes Riley to cry on her first day at her new school, causing a new sad \"core\" memory. Joy tries to dispose of this new memory, but she accidentally knocks core memories loose in a struggle with Sadness, and the shutdown of personality islands causing them to become unstable, and together Joy, Sadness and the core memories end up being sucked out of Headquarters through the memory tube, leading to the rest of Riley's mind, they end up in the labyrinth-like storage area of Riley's long-term memories. While Joy carrying the Core memories and Sadness are trying to get back to Headquarters, the three remaining emotions Anger, Disgust and Fear are attempting to maintain Riley's emotional state, but they inadvertently cause her to become distant from her Dad and Mom (Diane Lane), her friends and her hobbies, consequently her personality islands are crumbling and falling into the Memory Dump, an abyss where faded memories are disposed and forgotten. Anger decides to insert an idea for Riley to run away back to Minnesota, believing happy memories can be produced there, meanwhile Joy and Sadness have run into Riley's childhood imaginary friend Bing Bong (Richard Kind), who wishes to reconnect with her, he guides them back to Headquarters, telling them they can get there riding the Train of Thought, they explore different areas of Riley's mind along the way, including Dreamland and Imagination Land. They do eventually catch the train, but it becomes derailed with the collapse of another personality island, as Riley prepares to board a bus to Minnesota, Joy attempts to use a recall tube back to Headquarters, but the last personality island falls and breaks the tube, sending Joy and Bing Bong into the Memory Dump, she despairs and looks at memories, she finds a sad memory that became happy, when Riley lost a hockey game and was consoled by her parents, she realises Sadness's importance. Joy and Bing Bong find his discarded song- powered wagon to escape, but many failed attempts Bing Bong realises his weight is too much, so he jumps out on their final attempt and fades away in the abyss, Joy uses various tools from Imagination Land to propel herself and Sadness to Headquarters, there they find Anger's idea has disabled the control, making Riley depressed and almost unresponsive, returned Joy urges Sadness to take control, the idea is successfully removed, the console is reactivated and Riley is prompted to return home. Sadness reinstalls the core memories, Riley returns home and breaks down in tears, confessing to her parents she misses her old life, they reassure and comfort her, Joy and Sadness work together to create a combined core memory, it also creates a new personality island is created. A year later, Riley has adapted to her new life in San Francisco, all her emotions work together using an expanded control console and help her lead a happy and more emotionally complex life, with more new personality islands produced by new core memories combined by multiple emotions. Also starring Dave Goelz as Subconscious Guard Frank, Frank Oz as Subconscious Guard Dave, Red Hot Chili Peppers' Flea as Mind Worker Cop Jake and John Ratzenberger as Fritz. The voice cast are all chosen well, the characters all have good personalities and the colourful nature of this film will appeal to younger audience members, while the voices inside your head concept and complicated emotions working together element will keep the older audience interested, it perhaps becomes overcomplicated in small places, but memories, emotions and the human mind are complex subjects, it is clever, creative and fun family movie, an enjoyable animated adventure comedy. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and it was nominated for Best Writing, Original Screenplay, it won the BAFTA for Best Animated Film, and it was nominated for Best Original Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Animated.

		"reviewText": "This Disney/Pixar film is primarily set in the head of eleven year old Riley Andersen where five emotions; Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear and Anger are based. They live in 'Head Quarters' from where they control her temperament and help organise her memories. Overall they are primarily joyful but when her family moves away from her friends in Minnesota to a new home and a new life in San Francisco things start to go wrong. As Riley goes to her new school for the first time Sadness accidentally causes her to cry in front of her new classmates and for the first time a sad core memory is created. Joy tries to stop it being processed and in the process disrupts the other core memories deactivating Riley's 'personality islands'. As Joy struggles with Sadness the two of them and the core memories and removed from Head Quarters; this leaves Disgust, Fear and Anger trying to control Riley's emotions with disastrous results\u0085 if Joy and Sadness can't get back with the core memories Riley will suffer permanent emotional damage.\n\nI had heard that this film was something very special long before I eventually watched it\u0085 for me it definitely lived up to the hype. It is rather appropriate that a film about emotions is one of the most emotional I've seen for some time and fittingly, given that Joy and Sadness are the main characters, I shed tears of both joy and sadness before it was over. The creators did a beautiful job anthopomorphising the emotions in a way that created a story that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike. The voice actors do a fine job bringing these characters, as well as the human characters, to life. The story is told at a good pace and there are some gentle scares as well as some loss; particularly in an emotional scene of self-sacrifice involving Riley's previously forgotten imaginary friend. While it is sad at times there are just as many joyful moments as well as some good laughs. Overall I'd definitely recommend this film to people of all ages; I've only just watched it but want to watch it again soon.",

There's not much to the narrative (trouble-causing Sadness and ringleader Joy have to find their way out of the kid's long-term memory storage), while most of the attention is focused on the child's five basic emotions (the girl, Riley, and her parents rarely come to the fore as actual characters). Kids seem to enjoy the film because it's fluorescent and energetic, like a cereal commercial on television. With so much slapstick and shouting, it could easily compete with a restless child's attention span--and win. ** from ****",

Young Riley has many good memories, her friends, her hockey team.

Her memories are represented by different color spheres stored in permanent memory in head office. \n\nThe two main emotions we see are voiced by Amy Poehler as Riley's Joy and Phyllis Smith as Riley's Sadness.

		"reviewText": "Inside Out is one of the most daring films for children - and for adults as well - that I can think of from Hollywood, in the sense that it tells the audience \"look, not only can you be sad sometimes, you NEED to be sad\". That may be the ultimate takeaway, but it permeates a lot of the conflict of the film; there's no real key 'villain' here, and like Pixar's previous film, Monsters University, there's no really clear antagonist ala the robot in WALL-E or Jason Lee in the Incredibles. \n\nThe stakes are all about 'what is this person going to choose to do, to be, to have the growth and change of human experience?' And with kids too, it's a fascinating idea to explore in the depth this does. Many times as children, we're told to not be so sad, to pick up our spirits and be happy, or be happier, to not cry, to not be angry, and some children even get punished if they, say, cry too much or throw temper tantrums - if they're not \"normal\" in the sense of having constant joy. Look at Winnie the Pooh to see the many different takes on outlooks, such as Tigger being boundless energy, Pooh being curiosity, Piglet fear, Rabbit the 'brains', with Eeyore being the one who is constantly sad, and almost made to seem like kind of a punch-line, the \"Nobody's here but me\" deal.\n\nIf that sounds a little deep to take your four year old too, don't worry: this is one of the company's most entertaining and, often, funny films. It builds exponentially on the segment from Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, where we saw inside the mind of a man while on a date/during sex. Of course this is a PG kid's movie so it can't go there (It's an 11 year old-girl after all), but the filmmakers give us five 'emotions' with Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear, who all control little Riley as she goes about her life. When her family moves to San Francisco, and a mishap occurs in the control room - Joy and Sadness get taken away and, in maybe the one real Pixar trope (Toy Stories and Nemo come to mind), they got to get back to where they need to be.\n\nGrowing up and experiencing new things is what Inside Out is about, and getting there is the ultimate conflict. And while it appeals to kids who may be going through this (or will), and for adults who can tap into what Riley goes through, it doesn't stop for jokes involving the different places inside the consciousness sphere: sub-consciousness, 'Dream-Land' (the movie studio, with the dream filter over the camera lens for filming), Imagination-Land, and (my personal favorite) Abstract Thought, where beings turn step by step into shapes and colors.\n\nThis latter one shows off just how endlessly clever Pixar can be, by making doodles and figures one might see in a painting right before us. And even the Emotion characters themselves keep making the studio work wonders: look at how the hair and fibers on these things comes off and has the depth of detail one always look for in the films from these guys. By now the company could be resting on their laurels solely - and there are some more (unnecessary?) sequels to come. But Inside Out poses another challenge for them, to make all of these different 'lands' and environments, the max of the Memory Balls, the \"Train of Thought\", everything that shows everything was given consideration and metric-tons of creative wit.\n\nThere's many laughs to be had following along with Joy and Sadness as they try to find their way back, and this is balanced out by the very real, painful things that a child goes through, especially at the age of 11. It's difficult to make an authentic movie in live-action, but in animation it just comes off like a miracle of some kind; all of the peril means something, and a seemingly goofy side character, like Bing-Bong the imaginary friend to Riley, is fully realized as anyone else in the film. Watch when Riley's objects in Imagination Island fall away, and Bing-Bong doesn't know what to do with himself, as Sadness comes up and makes him go forward. Joy doesn't realize why this should be - why can't she cheer him up? It may or may not be obvious, which is what makes the storytelling so precise and tender and spot-on.\n\nSome clich\u00e9s are dealt with - have a dream with your underpants on and falling teeth, of course - and I wouldn't want it any other way in this film. Inside Out is rich in everything you want in a movie: comedy, drama, thrills, and, more than once real catharsis. It doesn't kid the kids, or the adults. You need everything inside you to be whole, is what it means to say, and it does it with brio and understanding of the human spirit.",
